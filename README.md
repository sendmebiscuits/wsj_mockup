# Dow Jones React Tutorial

## Description
Basic Express app with React and Hot Module Reloading, for use with the Dow Jones Tech React tutorial sessions. It is based off [this boilerplate](https://github.com/Timmehs/express-hmr-react), but has been stripped down to only support clientside rendering, and development mode.

## Usage
Weâ€™ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. We also use some ES6 syntax in this tutorial. We try to also include ES5 syntax in the comments, but we encourage you to [get familiar](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) with arrow functions, let, and const statements.

## Instructions
- [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node.js
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and [http://localhost:3000/api/articles](http://localhost:3000/api/articles) in browser

## Where is everything?
- Components in `/src`
- Page layout in `/client/app.js`
- CSS in `/client/style.main.css`
- Page template in `/client/template.js`
- Routes in `/server/index.js`
- Images in `/assets`
